# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

- The Object Oriented Programming means building/implementing real-world entities(`say organization or a thing or a box or a container`) like inheritance, polymorphism in programming.
- It helps bind our data and functions that work on that data together so as to restrict other parts of the code to directly access them.

### Building blocks of OOPs:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
6. Inheritance
7. Dynamic Binding
8. Message Passing

## Characteristics of Object Oriented Programming

1. Class:
- A Class is user defined data type which holds it's own data members(`variables`) and member functions(`functions`) that can be accessed by creating an instance of that class. 
- Classes are used to define the behavior and properties of a category of things.  E.g. A "Car" class might dictate that all cars be defined by their make, model, year, and mileage. But you can't provide specifics about a particular car (for example, that 1978 Chevy Impala with 205,000 miles on it that your uncle Mickey drives) until you create an "instance" of a Car. It's the instance that captures the detailed information about one particular car.

2. Object:
- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are the templates to create object. And hence objects are instance of a Class.
- When a class is defined no memory is assigned but when object is created then memory is assigned.
